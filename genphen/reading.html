			" \"Know how to solve every problem that has been solved.\" - Richard Feynman",
			" \"He who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser, sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved, drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
			" \"Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\" - Richard Feynman",
			" \"What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have yet to be discovered.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
			" \"Every man I meet is in some way my superior; and in that I can learn of him.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
			" \"I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
			" \"Nature is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the same.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
			" \"There's real poetry in the real world. Science is the poetry of reality.\" - Richard Dawkins",
			" \"All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.\" - Albert Einstein",
			" \"Wissenschaft und Kunst gehören der Welt an, und vor ihnen verschwinden die Schranken der Nationalität.\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
			" \"Science is the knowledge of many, orderly and methodically digested and arranged, so as to become attainable by one.\" - John Frederick William Herschel",
			" \"Science is the topography of ignorance.\" - Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.",
			" \"The great tragedy of Science — the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.\" - Thomas Henry Huxley",
			" \"Science is the first of sins, the germ of all sins, the original sin. This is all there is of morality—“Thou shalt not know”—the rest follows from that.\" - Friedrich Nietzsche",
			" \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\" - Max Planck",
			" \"Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.\" - Henri Poincaré",
			" \"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient truths; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.\" - Henri Poincaré",
			" \"Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking. This is central to its success. Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions.\" - Carl Sagan",
			" \"So many people today — and even professional scientists — seem to me like someone who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest.\" - Albert Einstein",
			" \"You could not step twice into the same river.\" - Heraclitus",
